# WebGPT

Delegate to signed-in Web ChatGPT through documented, authorized browser controls.
Write Codex-authored instructions to WebGPT in English by default; honor explicit language
requests and preserve source text where needed. Keep the requested deliverable language unchanged.
Read [setup.md](references/setup.md) only for an installation request or an observed missing
capability. Normal delegation reads workspace.md, not setup.md or the worker source.

## Open — user-controlled mode

For `webgpt open [project path]`, use the named project or current directory. This mode overrides
all delegation monitoring and cleanup below. Read workspace.md for the existing connection.
The request already authorizes creating the project's terminal connection, sharing its private URL
with signed-in ChatGPT and accepting the matching connection dialogs. Do not ask for consent again;
ask only for an action the user must personally perform, such as signing in.
Run `node <skill>/scripts/client.mjs open [project path]` once. It returns a stable connection name
and privately usable URL, reusing a live connection for the same project without renewing its lease.
Open a new tab and select the returned connection name in the composer plugin menu. If present,
handoff immediately: no setup reads, re-registration, process scans, probes or worker restart.
Only if absent, register that exact name and URL through setup.md's connection steps, then select it.
If `needsPublicOrigin` is returned, resolve the existing forwarding origin once and save
`publicOrigin` in the worker config; do not repeatedly search old notes or change the tunnel.
Never repoint an existing connection to a new session. Expired sessions receive fresh names and URLs.
This connection exposes only token-free terminal tools and binds the project on the server.
Preserve the current model unless specified. Do not type or send any message, task, token or probe;
the user starts the conversation. Verify the selected connection and absence of sent messages,
mark the tab as a deliverable using the browser's supported keep-open mechanism, and hand it over.
If connection setup fails, cancel only a newly created session (`reused:false`), not a reused one;
report the failure and never substitute a bootstrap
message or an unconnected tab. Stop after handoff: no wait,
collection, backup checks, chat deletion or tab closure. The user may send unlimited messages.
The worker automatically revokes access after 24 hours without terminal use, checked within one
minute; each successful terminal call renews it, and running commands are protected. Expiry never
deletes chats, tabs or project files. The persistent worker, not Codex, handles expiry.

The existing local Node.js worker, not an LLM, handles saved results, completion notification and
backup deadlines. Registration starts the deadline; completion/cancellation clears it automatically.
WebGPT only performs the assignment and submits its result. Do not ask it to report periodically,
start monitoring processes, or clean up chats. Codex receives the result and deletes the chat/tabs.
Reuse the worker and one quiet wait process; do not add per-task daemons or cron jobs.

## Dispatch

- The current ChatGPT Work picker separates the model from reasoning effort and renders them in
  one combined button. Resolve aliases as profiles, not literal button text:
  `xh|xhigh` = **GPT-5.6 Sol + Extra High** (Korean UI: `매우 높음`, default), while
  `p|pro` = **GPT-6 Astra**, the model behind GPT-6 Pro. Astra's visible reasoning effort is a
  separate choice; do not redefine `Pro` as `Ultra`, and do not accept Astra Extra High as `xh`
  or Sol Pro as `p`. A visibly observed legacy standalone `Extra High` or `Pro` control remains
  compatible. If the exact requested profile is unavailable, report it instead of substituting a
  different model.
- Send exactly one user message per task chat. Prepare the complete assignment before sending;
  never send follow-ups, corrections or continuation requests in that chat. If further work is
  needed, preserve and close the original task, then use a new chat with the necessary context.
- Explain the objective, necessary context and success criteria naturally. Let WebGPT choose
  its tools and approach within the user's scope. Put the assignment only in that chat message;
  do not duplicate it in registration files or generate task plans, ledgers or handoff documents
  unless needed for the actual deliverable. The worker already saves the result.
- For direct project work, use the WebGPT Worker terminal and
  [workspace.md](references/workspace.md). Set the project cwd; it is not a sandbox.
  Reuse verified setup; diagnose access only when unavailable or an actual call fails.
  Report missing access instead of silently doing the work yourself.
  Text-only tasks need no connector.
- Reuse registration output for the task ID; retain owned chat/tab identifiers in the current
  context. Do not create separate tracking files unless recovery genuinely requires one.
- Prepare the complete prompt and registration before opening the task tab. Include its session
  name in tab creation instead of a separate naming call when supported.
- Batch tab creation, current-mode/composer observation, any grounded mode selection, prompt
  entry and submission as far as documented controls allow. If the requested mode is already
  visible, skip selection. Return to the model only for unknown controls, ambiguity or a required
  gate; do not force a single blind call. Never invent model URL parameters or assume a mode.
  Fill and send together, then verify submission before any retry.

For browser observations, use documented `getAXState({emit:false})` after actions as well as before
them; output only lines needed for the next decision. Do not call bare `getAXState()` or write the
whole returned string: either can reintroduce large automatic output. For example:
`nodeRepl.write((await tab.getAXState({emit:false})).split('\n').filter(line => /Delete|Cancel/.test(line)).join('\n'))`.
Choose the filter for the actual UI language and needed controls; expand only if it misses them.
Reuse a visibly correct mode instead of reopening its settings. Request images only when text
cannot resolve the next action. Preserve mandatory first-use output, fresh target grounding and
permission gates; never echo image/base64 payloads as text or export the conversation by default.

After required browser initialization, import the pure CUA helpers where supported:
`var {sendOnce, deleteAndClose} = await import('<installed-skill>/scripts/browser.mjs')`.
Use `sendOnce(tab, prompt, 'xh'|'xhigh'|'p'|'pro')` on the new owned tab; after collection use
`deleteAndClose(tab, cua, browserId, ownedChatUrl)` after preserving the result and establishing
ownership. Helpers return compact outcomes and stop on unknown controls; handle those
with grounded UI actions. Never resend an unconfirmed submission. If imports are unavailable,
use documented CUA directly. Do not reread helper source during normal use.

## Collect

Use result acceptance, never continuous supervision. Delegate implementation and its relevant
tests together; request a concise result with changed files, check results, existing evidence paths and
remaining issues. Leave execution to WebGPT.

Wait for the saved completion event. Between events, do not inspect chats, screenshots, logs,
files or processes to track progress. Only when the worker returns `backupDue` (every **20 minutes**
for unfinished work), Codex makes one minimal chat-status check, not a progress audit or timeout.
The worker times the check; it does not read the browser. An explicit help/failure signal
or user intervention permits targeted handling, not continuous monitoring.
Keep empty wait renewals inside the runtime where supported; return to the model only for an
event, a due backup check or an actionable error. Do not narrate unchanged waiting.
Waiting requires an active parent runtime; this skill supplies no after-exit wake-up or cron job.

At completion, review the saved result once against the requested outcome. Reuse existing
evidence rather than creating duplicate reports; load only the summary, relevant diff and evidence,
not entire transcripts or logs. Distinguish PASS/FAIL/NOT_RUN; use the bundled collection command
to verify saved-result integrity and acknowledge receipt together.
Accept supported tests on the delivered version without rerunning them. Add only targeted checks
for failures, missing or conflicting evidence, subsequent integration changes, or an explicit
user/project requirement. Do not independently redo WebGPT's investigation or implementation.
A completion claim alone is not evidence. Resolve a concrete gap narrowly; otherwise acknowledge
and clean up. Preserve partial results and report blockers honestly.

The worker retires finished deadlines independently of Codex cleanup. Cancel abandoned tasks;
remove collected IDs from the next wait. Reconcile pending tasks after a context resume.

## Close

After preserving and accepting or rejecting the result (no separate report required):

- Task-chat cleanup is already authorized by the user's WebGPT request. Permanently delete the
  exact task chats, accept their matching deletion dialogs, then close their task tabs without
  asking the user again. A site's deletion dialog is an action to perform, not a new consent request.
  This applies to delegated tasks and setup tests, never user-controlled `webgpt open` chats.
- Verify chat deletion, then close and verify removal of all task-owned tabs, including recovery
  duplicates. Closing a tab is not proof of deleting its chat.
- Batch grounded menu/delete/dialog actions, deletion verification, tab closure and absence
  verification in one call when supported. Keep intermediate state checks inside that call and
  return only the final outcome. Resolve unknown controls with fresh observations; do not close
  before deletion is verified.
- Preserve unrelated chats, tabs, user data and shared services. Never delete uncollected work.
- Perform cleanup without unnecessary delays or repeated observations. If blocked, retain exact
  chat/tab identifiers and report the remaining action; do not claim cleanup complete.

For workflow smoke tests, use a trivial operation that executes in about one second, such as
printing a value. Do not assign development, research, or a test suite merely to test delegation.
Model, browser and network latency are separate and cannot be promised to finish in one second.
